- many used programs are located in solver/tests
  such as random_solutions_test.cpp which we used to generate problems

- most of the solver source code resides in solver/include/zebra (zebra is the namespace)
- solver/include/zebra/solver/brute.hpp is our best solver
  - solver/src/main.cpp contains the main function for the solver executable

- meta/ contains scripts for task / solution / submission management
